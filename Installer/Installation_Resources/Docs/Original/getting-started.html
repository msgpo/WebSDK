      <h1>About this Release</h1>
      <p>This is a beta release of the Sony Ericsson Web SDK. This means
      that functionality will change before final release.

      <p>Limitations are listed in <a href="release-notes.html">Release Notes</a>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Sony Ericsson is providing a Web SDK based on the open source PhoneGap framework, enabling developers to write
      native applications using HTML and JavaScript as an alternative to Java or C++.
      
      <p>The Web SDK supports
          <ul>
              <li> Sony Ericsson Android Xperia X10 and Symbian foundation based Satio phone.
          </ul>

      <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
      <p>
          
      <ul>
          <li>Java 6 SDK is required for the Web SDK to work properly.
          <li>To generate Android Web Applications, the Android SDK needs to be installed.
      </ul>

      <h1>Installation</h1>
      <p>To install the Web SDK start by downloading it from <a href="http://developer.sonyericsson.com/websdk"> Sony Ericsson Developer World</a>.

      <p>The installation procedure should be self-explanatory.

      <p>The installation will install the following:
      <ul>
        <li>The Sony Ericsson Web Application Generator</li>
        <li>Documentation, including this Getting Started document
      </ul>

      <h1>Using the Web Application Generator</h1>

      <p>The Web Application Generator takes a folder anywhere on your disk and generates an application for the selected target.

      <p>Assume you have added all your asset files in the folder <i>My App</i>. All you need to do is right-click on the folder and
      select the correct target.

      <div class="image">
        <img src="getting-started/context-menu.png">
      </div>

      <p>If you choose to generate Android application, the following dialog will pop up.

      <div class="image">
        <img src="getting-started/android-dialog.png">
      </div>

      <p>Just click on the "Make application" button. This will generate one signed and one
      unsigned APK-file. The signed APK-file is signed with the Android apkbuilder's default key.

      <p><i>The APK files will for now be generated in the asset directory so don't forget to remove the files
      before you regenerate the app</i>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="getting-started/folder-view.png">
      </div>

      <p>To run the application, upload it to the Android device or emulator.
