<h2>Darryl <strong>Flea</strong> Virostko</h2>


<p>We find a different Flea this year. In the summer of 2008, Virostko revealed that he is an alcoholic and had fallen deeply into a methamphetamine habit. He went into rehab that August, got himself clean, and recently established his own Santa Cruz center for drug-and-alcohol recovery, known as FleaHab. After two years of what he called "heavy" meth abuse, "I'm a new person now. I'm just fortunate I got out of (that period) without any felonies, without any DUIs, without killing someone. And I still have my physical health." His surfing, of course, needs no introduction. He won each of the first three Mavericks contests (1999, 2000, and 2004), and in a sport where classic wipeouts make history, Flea owns two: an epic free-fall during the 2004 Aikau contest and an inside-the-lip Mavericks disaster in December '07 on a face conservatively measured at 65 feed. No longer a crazy man on land, he'd like to prove he still has his legendary talent in the water.</p>
