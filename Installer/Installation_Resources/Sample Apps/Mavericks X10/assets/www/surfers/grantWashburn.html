<h2>Grant <strong>Washburn</strong></h2>


<p>From his filmmaking to his work on the book "Inside Maverick's" to his constant presence in the lineup, Washburn is probably the leading spokesman on Mavericks. He has no problem surfing it alone, in contrary winds, in fearsome conditions that would scare most people away. It is widely believed that Washburn puts in more Mavericks time than anyone, and not since Greg Noll has any big-wave rider been so doubly proficient at performance and documentation. Grant has produced two surf films, and with a massive personal collection of big-wave footage and interviews, he has much more in store. Always a standout at San Francisco's Ocean Beach and the Red Bull/South Africa contest, Washburn was a Mavericks finalist in 2004, 2006 and 2008.</p>
