<h2>James <strong>Sterling</strong></h2>


<p>Just as the Kin Bradshaw -Mark Foo crew gave way to the Brock Little generation, Sterling heads up the new wave of Hawaiian big-wave surfers, joining the likes of Mark Healey, Jamie O'Brien, Makua Rothman and Kalani Chapman as constant threats on the storied North Shore reefs. While many Hawaiians prefer the paradise of their home setting, Sterling travels extensively and has become a regular on the worldwide big-wave circuit. In the 2006 Billabong XXL awards, he took the trophy for Best Overall Performance. He finished an impressive third in the 2008 Mavericks contest, after dominating his first two heats, and he won the Jay Moriarity Award that day for the spirit best exemplifying the late, great Santa Cruz surfer.</p>
