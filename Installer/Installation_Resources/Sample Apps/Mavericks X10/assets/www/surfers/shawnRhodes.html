<h2>Shawn <strong>Rhodes</strong></h2>


<p>Work and family commitments have become recent priorities for the 38-year-old Rhodes, longtime owner of the NorCal surf shop in Pacifica, "but when it's really giant," says Jeff Clark, "Shawn's the kind of guy you see out at Mavericks when everyone else is running for cover." He's been a main-list entrant since the contest first began and has shown a thirst for getting in the tube- no mean feat at this spot. </p>
