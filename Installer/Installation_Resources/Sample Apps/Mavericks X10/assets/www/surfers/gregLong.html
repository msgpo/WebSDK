<h2>Greg <strong>Long</strong></h2>


<p>He's the king of hardware, consistently raking up awards in the annual Billabong XXL judging, but the most accurate measurement is his heart. With a calm, almost stunningly humble demeanor, Long blends into the scene wherever he goes-while catching the craziest, largest waves. Among his Billabong trophies: Biggest Wave (Dungeons, Sough Africa) in 2007, Best Overall Performance and Biggest Paddle-In (Todos Santos) in 2008, and Ride of the Year (Dungeons) in 2009. In December of 2007, he surfed a single swell in Hawaii, Northern California and Mexico over the course of 72 hours- an unprecedented feat. And he rode that biggest-ever day with Twiggy and friends two years ago at Cortes Bank. The essence of Greg's spirit, though, came in the '08 Mavericks contest. Waiting out a lull during the final, Long and the other five surfers agreed to split the winnings equally - no matter who came out on top. Long wound up winning in picture-perfect conditions and drew worldwide respect for his sportsmanship.</p>
