<h2>Grant <strong>Twiggy</strong> Baker</h2>

<p>Some were surprised when this South African was voted into one of the 2006 contest's last five slots, having never heard his name. They know it now. Baker, after taking a crash course in Mavericks surfing from Washburn, won the event with a dominant, inspirational performance. A big-wave star in his native country, Baker mastered the difficult Mavericks takeoff in a very short time, performing as if he's surfed the place for decades. He finished second to Greg Long in the 2008 contest, won for Biggest Wave and Best Overall Performance in this year's Billabong awards, and shared the experience of a lifetime with Long, Mike Parsons and Brad Gerlach in January of '08 venturing out to Cortes Bank (off the California coast) to tow-surf waves widely recognized as the largest ever surfed. </p>
