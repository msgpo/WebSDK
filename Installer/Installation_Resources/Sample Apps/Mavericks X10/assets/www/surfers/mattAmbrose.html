<h2>Matt <strong>Ambrose</strong></h2>


<p>Others may get more publicity, but the 38-year-old Ambrose represents the heart and soul of Mavericks. He was there from the beginning, part of the original, Pacifica-based crew in the early 90's, and if you want to know who rides the deepest, just find out where Ambrose has positioned himself. Grant Washburn likes to joke that if there were no official contest, "We'd just hold the Matt Ambrose Challenge. Whoever gets the biggest, nastiest wave- an Ambrose wave- would win." Once known as an underground warrior, Ambrose has become an established name after reaching the Mavericks finals in four of the past five contests.</p>
