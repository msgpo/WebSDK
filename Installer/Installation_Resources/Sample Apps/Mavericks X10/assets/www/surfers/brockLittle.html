<h2>Brock <strong>Little</strong></h2>

<p>It wasn't easy for Little to return to Mavericks after his first experience- the December 23, 1994 swell that killed his fellow Hawaiian, Mark Foo. Little nearly met his own demise that day, but he always makes a point of coming back for the Mavericks contest. Forever known for his epic takeoff on a 60-foot face in the 1990 Eddie Aikau contest, and more recently as a sought-after Hollywood stuntman, the 41-year-old Little has a solid Mavericks record: seventh in 1999, seventh (in a tie with Jay Moriarity) in 2000, another equal seventh (with Shawn Rhodes) in 2005, and third place in 2006.</p>
