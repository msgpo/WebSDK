<h2>Tyler <strong>Smith</strong></h2>


<p>People saw photos and videos of Smith riding the surrealistically large "Ghost Tree" break, in Monterey, and wondered, "Who is this guy?" They have found the answer in Mavericks contests, where the Santa Cruz-based Smith finished third in 2005 (sliding into the main draw as an alternate and surfing his way into the final), second in the 2006 event and fourth in 2008. Those are the last three Mavericks contests to be held, and Smith is the only man to have reached all three finals. </p>
