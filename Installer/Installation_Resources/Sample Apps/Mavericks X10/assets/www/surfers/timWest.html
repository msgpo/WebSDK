<h2>Tim <strong>West</strong></h2>


<p>The best of the up-and-coming generation from the Half Moon Bay coastside, West is confident, level-headed and a regular whenever Mavericks is going off. Considering all of the other Mavericks hazards, most surfers would be "over it" if they ever saw a shark out there. Back in November of 2005, West actually had a shark rise from the depths and crash into his surfboard as he was paddling out. West was shaken especially when he saw a shark's tooth embedded in his board, but he never lost his commitment to surfing the place. He now comes off a summer mostly dedicated to riding giant barrels at Puerto Escondido, Mexico. </p>
