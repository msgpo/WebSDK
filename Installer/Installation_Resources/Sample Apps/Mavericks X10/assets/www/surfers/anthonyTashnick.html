<h2>Anthony <strong>Tashnick</strong></h2>

<p>A legend at 16, when he stepped up to ride what may called the "wave of the winter" at Mavericks in 2001, Tashnick is now a mainstay on the world of big-wave riding. The latest in a long line of chargers from the West Side of Santa Cruz, Tashnick won the 2005 Mavericks contest in such dominant fashion, there was no question who would tae home the trophy. Well-traveled in his thirst for big waves, Tashnick has made the alternate list of the prestigious Eddie Aikau contest three straight years.</p>
