<h2>Ben <strong>Andrews</strong></h2>

<p>This San Francisco-based surfer made a name for himself by catching a huge Mavericks wave in December of '06, earning him a nomination for the Billabong XXL (worldwide) Monster Paddle-in award. Andrews came back to earn a similar nomination two years ago, an unforgettable image that saw him make a nearly-impossible Mavericks drop before getting buried by an avalanche of whitewater. He has drawn respect by consistently putting in time at the break-a very good way to earn a main-list invitation. </p>
