<h2>Nathan <strong>Fletcher</strong></h2>


<p>A number of elite surfers have caught Fletcher's act over the past few years and pronounced him among the five best big-wave surfers in the world. The youngest son in the noted Fletcher family from Southern California, Nathan shied away from surfing in his youth, only to emerge as a stunning talented, fearless rider. He's been a Mavericks standout on huge days, including the stored November '09 swell described as the best ever for paddle-in conditions, and he staged a sensational early-round performance at the January '08 Backdoor Shootout in Hawaii on one of the biggest Pipeline days ever ridden in a contest.</p>
