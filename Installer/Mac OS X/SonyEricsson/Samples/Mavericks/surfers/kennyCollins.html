<h2>Kenny <strong>Skindog</strong> Collins</h2>


<p>Whether it's tow-surfing or paddling, Collins tends to stand out on the most fearsome days at Mavericks. He pioneered the Northern California tow-in movement with Peter Mel in the late 1990s and was part of a titanic semifinal in the 2000 contest that will go down with the most memorable heats in surfing history. A life-threatening wipeout at "Jaws," in December of 2004, had Collins pausing to sort out his priorities. But he has bounced back with a vengeance. In the summer of '06, he came out of a massive tube at Puerto Escondido- one of the most sensational performances ever witnessed at the famed Mexico break- to win both Ride of the Year and Monster Tube in the XXL Awards. </p>
