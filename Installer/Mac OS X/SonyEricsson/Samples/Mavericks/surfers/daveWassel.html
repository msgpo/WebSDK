<h2>Dave <strong>Wassel</strong></h2>

<p>Mavericks locals welcomed this longtime underground charger from Hawaii, where he serves as a North Shore lifeguard and ranks among the most respected members of the Pipeline crew. His first-ever wave at Mavericks three years ago, a bomb from well outside the bowl, nearly gained him the XXL Paddle-In award. He now makes Mavericks a priority, surfing with distinction during the epic November '08 swell, and he made the semifinals two years ago after gaining entry as an alternate. "You can't compare this place to Hawaii," he says. "It's got cold water, giant sharks, giant waves and giant rocks. It's like nothing else."</p>
