<h2>Peter <strong>Mel</strong></h2>


<p>To say that he's "due" would be putting it mildly. For years, Mel has been the hands-down choice as Mavericks most talented, influential surfer. He helped launch the Northern California tow-in movement and ranks with Schmidt as the best known Northern California surfers in Hawaiian events (especially the Aikau contest) over the years. But he still hasn't won at Mavericks, having fallen victim to bad luck, bad timing, and (in his opinion) perhaps a dubious judging call or two. Two years ago, when he finished fourth in his first-round heat, might have been his biggest disappointment. If for nothing beyond his peace of mind, Mel needs this trophy.</p>
