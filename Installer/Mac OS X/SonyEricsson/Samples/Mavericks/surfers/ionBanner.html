<h2>Ion <strong>Banner</strong></h2>


<p>For a lot of locals around Half Moon Bay, Banner's presence truly validates the event. Banner has been charging huge waves along the coast for years, without much fanfare, and he was the first Half Moon Bay surfer ever to make the main list (in his days as contest director, Jeff Clark always preferred to run the event while staying out of the competition). Always a standout in past contests, Banner gained singular recognition two years ago for his amazing air-drops and whimsical switch-stance maneuvers. He has since become a regular partner with Tim West on tow-in days. </p>
