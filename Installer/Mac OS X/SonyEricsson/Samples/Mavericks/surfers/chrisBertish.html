<h2>Chris <strong>Bertish</strong></h2>


<p>South African hellman who once drew notice by surfing Mavericks, then Todos Santos (Mexico) and finally Jaws (Hawaii) on a single swell. Known to pull into any barrel at any size-the quickest way to gain respect in the big-wave surfing community. The South African influence was launched several years ago when Grant Washburn, a regular in the summertime Red Bull contest, told stories of his legendary break back home. Bertish, Twiggy and a few others now try to make at least one Mavericks trip annually.</p>
