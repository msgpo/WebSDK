<h2>Evan <strong>Slater</strong></h2>

<p>In methodical, relentless fashion, Slater is making his mark as one of the all-time greats of big-wave riding. A number of things could have sidetracked him-becoming editor of Surfing Magazine, raising a family, taking a career-threatening wipeout (forcing major knee surgery) at Mavericks- but it seems he's always there when it matters. It took a great performance from Flea Virostko to keep Slater from winning the 2004 contest (he finished second). Emerging from a tough semifinal in 2006, he placed an overall sixth while taking one of his signature wipeouts along the way. He finished sixth again in '08.</p>
