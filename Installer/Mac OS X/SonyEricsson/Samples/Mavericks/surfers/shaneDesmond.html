<h2>Shane <strong>Desmond</strong></h2>


<p>Undoubtedly the most respected backside surfer in Mavericks history, having  ridden the place with fearless abandon since the mid-1990s. Some say only a crazy man would consistently surf Mavericks with his back to the wave, but Desmond- a low-key bartender for years in his native Santa Cruz- has proven to be an extremely smart, calculating performer. He won the 2005 XXL Paddle-In award for an astounding ride during the Mavericks contest, and he's an accomplished contest surfer on longboards when the waves drop to more normal levels.</p>
