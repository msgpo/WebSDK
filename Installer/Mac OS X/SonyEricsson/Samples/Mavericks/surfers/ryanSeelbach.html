<h2>Ryan <strong>Seelbach</strong></h2>


<p>Out of San Francisco, where he hones his big-water skills at the challenging Ocean Beach, Seelbach is no stranger to Mavericks chaos. He managed to advance out of his first heat in the 2005 contest despite having to retrieve his lost board from the distant lagoon. He missed much of the '06 winter after breaking his foot during a tow-in session. But he has become a highly esteemed regular, reaching the semifinals two years ago, and he was a standout during the mind-blowing December '07 tow-in sessions that marked some of the biggest waves ever ridden at Mavericks. </p>
