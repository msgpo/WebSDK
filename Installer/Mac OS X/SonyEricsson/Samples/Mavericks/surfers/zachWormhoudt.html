<h2>Zach <strong>Wormhoudt</strong></h2>


<p>Another key member of the West Side crew from Santa Cruz, Wormhoudt got some long-overdue recognition in 2004, when he won the Billabong XXL Award for the biggest paddle-in wave of the winter. He is among the most accomplished tow-surfers in the world, earning a Biggest Wave nomination in last winter's Billabong XXL awards for a ride at Nelscott Reef, Oregon. But he is most true to his paddling and is among the most consistently solid performers in the history of the Mavericks contest, having finished eighth in the 1999, fifth in 2000 and fourth in 2005. </p>
