<h2>Carlos <strong>Burle</strong></h2>

<p>The best-known big-wave rider from Brazil, heralded for his strong performances in Hawaii (he's a fixture on this Eddie Aikau contest main list), Burle makes sure he visits Mavericks a few times each winter. He has caught some of the biggest tow-in waves on record, including a kelp-ridden monster at Ghost Tree that earned him 2009 Billabong XXL award nominations for Monster Tube and Ride of the Year. He also won Biggest Wave honors in 2002 for a Mavericks wave measured at 68 feet on the face.</p>
