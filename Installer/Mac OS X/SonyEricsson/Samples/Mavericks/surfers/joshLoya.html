<h2>Josh <strong>Loya</strong></h2>


<p>This West Side/Santa Cruz veteran has admitted to a fear of heights, but staring down the ledge of a Mavericks beast doesn't seem to bother him. Respected worldwide for his grace and elegance in any conditions, Loya has been surfing Mavericks for years, graduating effortlessly into tow-in movement while keeping in touch with his paddle-in skills. Like his Santa Cruz compatriots Mel and Richard Schmidt, Loya became a polished surfer through years of lengthy wintertime pilgrimages to Hawaii. </p>
